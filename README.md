# diy-automated-garden-kit

Thanks for popping by our little bot of code. If you randomly came across this, here we are hosting some code which we use with an Arduino based DIY watering kit for small plants. The setup itself uses a Wemos D1 Mini, Capacitive mositure sensor, PWN controller thats connect to a submersible water pump and of course some wires.

 If your an Arduino pro, I imagine you may already have these parts so please feel free to use this code how ever you want. If you wanted to check out the kit we use, check out our online store for more info. All sales help us look at developing and putting together mores kits, learning videos and live shows for our local community and the wider world! Your support will be super appreciated!
